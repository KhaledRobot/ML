The evidence presented, especially the testimony, has significant limitations that cast doubt on its reliability. The witness's poor observation conditions, including inadequate lighting and not wearing their glasses, undermine the credibility of the testimony. The principle that it is better to let guilty persons go free rather than wrongly convict an innocent person is paramount in our justice system. Hence, given the reasonable doubt introduced by the evidence presented, the verdict must be not guilty. The integrity of the legal process demands that we err on the side of caution and protect the rights of the accused.\n",
